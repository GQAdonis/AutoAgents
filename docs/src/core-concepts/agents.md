# Agents

Agents are the core building blocks of the AutoAgents framework. They represent autonomous entities that can understand
tasks, reason about solutions, execute actions through tools, and provide intelligent responses. This document explores
the agent system in detail.

## What is an Agent?

An agent in AutoAgents is a software entity that exhibits the following characteristics:

- **Autonomy**: Can operate independently without constant human intervention
- **Reactivity**: Responds to changes in their environment
- **Proactivity**: Can take initiative to achieve goals
- **Social Ability**: Can interact with other agents and systems
- **Intelligence**: Uses reasoning patterns to solve problems
